First your Openwrt access points will need to have the following installed.

ebtables
hostapd-utils
nc  a recompiled version of busybox with nc server support (or the full version of busybox?) or netcat
renice  either a recompiled version of busybox with renice support (or the full version of busybox?)
# If you dont care about setting the process priority you can just comment out the lines with renice in them.
tcpdump or tcpdump-mini

If your /tmp directory is not mounted using tmpfs then you should change any references to the /tmp directory to a directory that is mounted
using tmpfs this will improve performance and reduce drive wear.
You should alsow change any ip addresses to what you are using.

On the Openwrt access points:

Create the directory /usr/local/bin
Copy ApRoamBlock/ApRoamBlock to /usr/local/bin/
Copy ApRoamClient/ApRoamClient to /usr/local/bin/
Copy ApRoamDeauth/ApRoamDeauth to /usr/local/bin/
copy ApRoamSta/ApRoamSta to /usr/local/bin/
# If using included precompiled busybox binary.
Copy Busybox/busybox /usr/local/bin/ (MIPS processor only)

Copy etc/init.d/openwrt/ApRoamClient /etc/init.d/
Copy etc/init.d/openwrt/ApRoamDeauth /etc/init.d/
Copy etc/init.d/openwrt/ApRoamSta /etc/init.d/

On the Server ( ApRoamControl machine ):

Create the directory /usr/local/bin
Copy ApRoamControl/ApRoamControl /usr/local/bin/
# You will probably want to change the log path in the script to something else. (/tmp/ApRoamControl.log /var/log/ApRoamControl.log etc)
Copy etc/logrotate.d/ApRoamControl /etc/logrotate.d/
# Change the log path to what you set in ApRoamControl.
Copy ApRoamSrv/ApRoamSrv1 /usr/local/bin/
Copy ApRoamSrv/ApRoamSrv2 /usr/local/bin/
Copy ApRoamSrv/ApRoamSrv3 /usr/local/bin/
# If you need more than three access points just copy ApRoamSrv1 to ApRoamSrv4 etc.. and change the port numbers in the script (401 to 404 etc..).
Copy ApRoamSta/ApRoamSta1 /usr/local/bin/
Copy ApRoamSta/ApRoamSta2 /usr/local/bin/
Copy ApRoamSta/ApRoamSta3 /usr/local/bin/
# If you need more than three access points just copy ApRoamSta1 to ApRoamSta4 etc.. and change the port numbers in the script (601 to 604 etc..).
Copy etc/init.d/server/ApRoamControl /etc/init.d/
Copy etc/init.d/server/ApRoamSrv1 /etc/init.d/
Copy etc/init.d/server/ApRoamSrv2 /etc/init.d/
Copy etc/init.d/server/ApRoamSrv3 /etc/init.d/
# If you need more than three access points just copy ApRoamSrv1 to ApRoamSrv4 etc.. and change any internal references from ApRoamSrv1 to ApRoamSrv4 etc.
Copy etc/init.d/server/ApRoamSta1 /etc/init.d/
Copy etc/init.d/server/ApRoamSta2 /etc/init.d/
Copy etc/init.d/server/ApRoamSta3 /etc/init.d/
# If you need more than three access points just copy ApRoamSta1 to ApRoamSta4 etc.. and change any internal references from ApRoamSta1 to ApRoamSta4 etc.

Once you have all the paths, ip addresses and ports set correctly just start up all the init.d scripts /etc/init.d/ApRoamControl start etc. There start order shouldn't matter.
